# Shellhacks2024
Inspiration
With the recent events, we were reminded of the chaos and disaster that comes with hurricanes. Often times in these situations, first responders fail to distribute aid and supplies in an efficient manner due to lack of data and lack of intelligent pathfinding systems.

What it does
The purpose of this project is to empower first responders with intelligent solutions to resource allocation by leveraging powerful search algorithms and visualizing data in real-time.

How we built it
Swift Response utilizes Flask as its web app framework and uses JavaScript for the backend. Swift Response is powered by a variation of Uniform Cost Search that uses a custom cost function that factors in distance and priority to return the optimal path.

Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we faced was coming up with the right cost function for our algorithm. Early iterations were biased or inadmissible. Another challenge was integrating the algorithm into our program in a way that worked with our front end.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of succeeding in our purpose and successfully applying algorithms to real-world problems.

What we learned
One of the biggest skills we gained with this project was connecting back and front ends together. No one on our team had any full-stack experience but together we found solutions to our hardest problems
